Passionate about technology and continuous improvement, I have been a dedicated Full Stack Developer since 2013. My career began while I was still completing my Computer Science degree, diving into the world of web development. This early start was fueled by my fascination with the limitless possibilities of creating globally accessible applications with minimal resources.

Over the years, I have mastered a variety of technologies, beginning with PHP and its numerous frameworks such as Wordpress, Codeigniter, and Laravel, which enabled me to quickly excel in backend development. Coupled with my early skills in HTML, JavaScript, and CSS, and my initial use of style libraries like Bootstrap, I evolved into a Full Stack Developer capable of handling entire applications from the ground up. Recently, I have particularly enjoyed using TailwindCSS for its utility-first approach to styling, which complements my focus on efficient and scalable CSS design.

My interest in optimizing web project infrastructure led me to embrace virtualization technologies like Docker and Kubernetes, enhancing my projects' scalability and reproducibility. As the web development landscape evolved, so did my skills; I ventured into modern frontend frameworks, finding a particular affinity for React and Vue, which are now staples in my development toolkit.

I am a firm believer in clean, maintainable, and testable code. My approach is always guided by best practices in software architecture, including DDD, hexagonal architecture, and SOLID principles. This not only ensures robust applications but also aligns with my perfectionist drive to enhance every aspect of my projects, from coding standards to testing strategies.

I value constructive feedback and respect differing viewpoints, seeing each critique as an opportunity for growth and improvement. My willingness to embrace feedback has continually enhanced my professionalism and technical skills.

Currently, I leverage my comprehensive experience and deep understanding of both frontend and backend to develop scalable REST APIs and dynamic frontend applications. My work is characterized by a strong commitment to quality and a proactive attitude towards embracing new challenges.

As I continue to advance my skills and explore new technologies, I am keen to collaborate with like-minded professionals and companies that prioritize innovation and quality in software development.

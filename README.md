After university I entered into the world of web development and I could not escape.

I started learning by myself HTML, CSS, PHP and JS going through Codeigniter, Laravel, Symfony and Magento. Falling in love with Laravel.

Then the frontend frameworks came out, trying React and Vue, staying with the second one.

Now I am more focused on learning about best programming practices, like DDD and hexagonal architecture among others.

Also I'm interested in the world of web 3.0, cryptocurrencies and blockchain
